The Rasphub PCO works by utilizing the power of a bad usb/rubber ducky. It acts like a HID (Human Interface Device) in the form of a keyboard. So, basically it's just a little computer that acts like a keyboard and stores up to 8 strings (texts). You plug it into your computer with a USB-A to Micro-USB charger.
