Scripted works by utilizing the power of a bad usb/rubber ducky. It acts like a HID (Human Interface Device) in the form of a keyboard. So, basically it's just a little computer that acts like a keyboard and stores up to 8 strings (texts). You plug the Rasphub PCO with the latest version of Scripted installed into your computer with a USB-A to Micro-USB cable. Then, you can press the button that you've stored the text string in. It will type like a human. It will make mistakes and correct them. It writes at different speeds to make it seem like a real person is writing. 

You can use Scripted to cheat on tests. That's the main point of it. You can use it as a Bad USB, but then you need the latest version of Governor for it to work.
